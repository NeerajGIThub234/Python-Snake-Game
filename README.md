This is a Python Snake Game built using the Tkinter library. Control the snake with arrow keys as it moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own body. Each piece of food eaten increases the score, displayed at the top of the window. The game ends if the snake hits the boundaries or itself, displaying a "Game Over" message. This project demonstrates essential game development concepts, such as handling user input, managing game state, and using simple animations with Tkinter.
